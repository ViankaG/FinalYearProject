            <h1>Information About Types of Dementia</h1>
            <p>
                This page includes information about the different types of conditions that can cause dementia and links to share
                them on social websites. Dementia is the term used for a group of symptoms related to an ongoing decline of 
                brain functioning.

            <h2>Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <p>
                According to the NHS, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Around 60% to 70% of 
                people living with dementia globally are estimated to have this condition. Alzheimer's disease is a 
                progressive condition, this means that the symptoms develop slowly over a number of years and become more serious 
                over time. There is no cure to Alzheimer's disease however, there are medications that can temporarily help to 
                improve or slow development of symptoms. 
            </p>
            <h3>Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
            <p>
                The main symptom of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss. Other symptoms include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes in personality and behaviour, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others</li>
                    <li>Depression or anxiety</li>
                    <li>Problems with speech and language</li>
                    <li>Confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places</li>
                    <li>Difficulty planning or making decisions</li>
                    <li>Problems moving around without assistance or completing self-care tasks</li>
                    <li>
                        Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are not 
                        true)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Vascular Dementia</h2>
            <p>
                Vascular dementia affects the blood vessels in the brain resulting in changes to memory, thinking and behaviour.
                Vascular dementia is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain, such as from a stroke. The decrease in blood
                flow causes brain damage, which can lead to vascular dementia developing. It can occur alone or be a part of 
                another diagnosis, such as Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Symptoms of vascular dementia can 
                develop slowly or can occur suddenly and develop over time. As well as this, the symptoms of vascular dementia 
                are similar to the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
            </p>
            <h3>Symptoms of Vascular Dementia</h3>
            <p>
                Symptoms include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Slowness of thought</li>
                    <li>Feeling confused and disoriented</li>
                    <li>Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, such as problems with memory and language</li>
                    <li>Difficulty walking and keeping balance</li>
                    <li>Problems with concentration</li>
                    <li>Changes to mood, personality and behaviour, such as depression, anxiety and anger</li>
                    <li>Changes in sleep patterns</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Dementia with Lewy Bodies</h2>
            <p>
                Dementia with Lewy bodies (also known as Lewy body dementia) is caused by Lewy body disease. This disease causes 
                small clumps of proteins, known as Lewy bodies, to appear in the brain. Lewy bodies can be found in different 
                types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. As well as this, Lewy bodies are a main brain abnormality in 
                Parkinson's disease dementia. Multiple people with dementia with Lewy bodies experience problems with 
                movement, such as rigid muscles, a shuffling walk and trouble initiating movement. These are also common symptoms
                of Parkinson's disease. 
            </p>
            <h3>Symptoms of Dementia with Lewy Bodies</h3>
            <p>
                As with other types of dementia, the symptoms for dementia with Lewy bodies can slowly get worse over time. 
                Symptoms include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Problems with staying focused</li>
                    <li>Memory loss</li>
                    <li>Difficulties with making decisions</li>
                    <li>Slowness in movement</li>
                    <li>Parts of the body shaking when at rest</li>
                    <li>Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there)</li>
                    <li>Very disturbed sleep</li>
                </ul>
