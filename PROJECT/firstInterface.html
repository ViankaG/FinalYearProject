        <h2>Memory Book</h2>
        <p>
            A memory book could be an activity book that can be bought or a book filled with personal pictures made by your 
            carer. An activity book has many activities to decrease memory loss such as, puzzles and brain games. Some activities 
            are for different moods and energy levels. Also, some activity books have advice and information about dementia 
            for your carer. Memory or activity books can help you remember your past and encourage long-term memory.
            A book filled with personal pictures made by your carer can include pictures from:
            <ul> 
                <li>Your childhood</li>
                <li>Close family and friends</li>
                <li>Special occasions</li>
                <li>Interests</li>
                <li>Previous homes</li>   
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Telecare Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Telecare systems are used to help you stay safe. You can set the system up to alert chosen family members or friends
            when there are issues and it allows you to have access to support when needed. Community alarms, sensors and 
            movement detectors are included in telecare systems. Alarms can be connected to a nominated person or a call centre. 
            When the sensor detects an issue or when the person using the system presses the community alarm, then the nominated 
            person or call centre will be alerted. Telecare systems need a telephone line or internet to function.
            Telecare systems can be used in different situations. It can be used as:
            <ul>
                <li>Community alarm</li>
                <li>Monitored medication reminders</li>
                <li>Bed or chair absence sensors</li>
                <li>Door sensors</li>
                <li>Flood sensors in the house</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Location Monitoring Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Location monitoring devices are also designed to help you stay safe when travelling somewhere. If you are a person 
            who is at risk of getting lost or going missing, then this is very useful. These devices use mobile phone or 
            satellite technology to locate you, it depends on the type of device you choose. There are many devices to choose
            from, for example, you could get a watch, a key ring or a pendant. You can give a family member or a friend 
            permission to know where you are. Your location can be seen on their computer, tablet or smart phone. On some devices
            there is also a panic button and a feature that allows you to communicate with your chosen family member or friend.
